# HistSumm
Code and data for [Summarising Historical Text in Modern Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10759.pdf) (EACL 2021)

## TL;DR
*Historical text summarisation* is a task where documents in historical forms of a language are summarised in the corresponding modern language. We are the first to explore this fascinating and meaningful direction (through cross-lingual transfer learning). Our repo contains
 - [x] **Testsets** for German and Chinese, annotated by experts
 - [x] Preprocessing code
 - [ ] Trained & aligned embeddings
 - [ ] Neural summariser

## Corpus
Some of the entries may be puzzling. We thus explain them here
| entry             	| description                                                                    	|

| (de) region       	| historical German has dialects, so it's important to log the geometric sources 	|

## Code and model
### Preprocessing
As suggested by anonymous reviewers, we release our preprocessing step for reproducibility check as well as to aid future studies on historical language processing. Our code is presented in documented Jupyter Notebooks.

### Embeddings and summariser code
To be released near the conference (late April) :eyes:
